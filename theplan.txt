  idea
		// the classes should have an alias in the db
		the alias should be 
		e.g 
	=>  classes:{
		grade1:{
			aliasName{
				boys:{}
				girls:{}
			}
	}	
		}
	=	add the ability to delete a class from the addClass icon on hover

	= should have a way of comparing how many students are available in a session year vs another session year

	= a way to know how many students is still available auto increment till a particular class thing till a particular class

	= and on boarding page where the data is collected for the name of the school which will be used to init the db
		-> the onboarding should tell the user to select classes available in their school
	=
